# AI_POWER_HONEYPOT
The project is an AI-Powered Deception Grid that uses smart honeypots to trick cyber attackers and analyze their behavior in real time. It automatically responds to threats and improves security by learning from real attack patterns.

# AI-Powered Cowrie Honeypot

This project is a smart honeypot defense system using Cowrie, machine learning, and LSTM-based sequence detection. It identifies, visualizes, and blocks brute-force attackers automatically.

## Features
- SSH honeypot using Cowrie
- Real-time log analysis
- LSTM-based threat detection
- Auto-blocking malicious IPs
- Attack pattern visualization

## How to Run
1. Set up Cowrie
2. Run `analyze_logs.py`
3. Train model with `train_model.py` or `train_lstm.py`
4. Block threats using `auto_block.py`
5. Visualize with `dashboard.py`
